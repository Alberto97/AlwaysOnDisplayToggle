This app adds a tile to the quick settings panel that turns Always on Display on or off.
The app needs to write to the system settings. Therefore the related permission has to be granted via Shizuku or from your computer with adb in order for the app to work properly:

adb shell pm grant org.alberto97.aodtoggle android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS

Please note that this app has only been tested on Google Pixel.
Different manufacturers may have implemented AoD their own way and therefore the app might not work.
